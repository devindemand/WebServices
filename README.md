# WebServices
Used Jersey Client / RestFiul client to download ZIP/Read Huge CSV / Post Data to a webservice / Get data from a webservice

I've used JACKSON Streaming API to parse huge JSON and extract part of the JSON which was downloaded using a GET Call to the webservice
I've used basic Http Authentication in the webservice calls.
